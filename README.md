This app is to track best sellers rank on amazon.com between a few products in the same category.
The app will scrape the best seller ranks from amazon.com for inputted asins and display it as explained below.
The app should have a refresh button , add product button, and the main activity.
The add button, should bring up a screen with a title field, Category field and 6 times label field ASIN, field. Please see attached mockup
Main activity will display for each product the title the label and the best seller rank for the asin corresponding to the label. Please see attached mockup
By category I mean for example “Antitheft Remote Starters” for ASIN B07F422Y98 https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07F422Y98
The refresh button will refresh best seller ranks for all products entered.
To scrape from amazon.com you need to “trick” amazon to think you are a browser. If you don’t know how to do it I can show you how.

You will deliver an APK file and android studio source code.

Please only place a bid for your actually bid. Do not place a bid and than raise your price.
